                        "Occupying a truly magical position overlooking Loch Dunvegan on the western side of Skye is this beautiful two-bedroom house." +
                        "Contextually conceived by award-winning Dualchas Architects, the house emulates the feel and warmth of a traditional West Highland blackhouse;" +
                        "striking greying larch external façades merge seamlessly with wonderfully light Scandinavian modernist interiors. The house has been cleverly oriented," +
                        "within a garden of around 0.9 acres, to capture open views across the calming water and towards spectacular mountains and the striking flat-topped Macleod's Table.\n\n" +

                        "The Architect\n\n" +

                        "Dualchas Building Design was founded on Skye in 1996 by brothers Alasdair Stephen and Neil Stephen. The practice established a second office in Glasgow in 2006," +
                        "and six years later, the firm was renamed Dualchas Architects. From considered beginnings, Dualchas has sought inspiration from the authentic local vernacular," +
                        "often the blackhouse, spearheading cultural confidence and a contemporary renaissance in the architecture of the Highlands.\n" +

                        "They work on remote and wild sites throughout the Highlands and Islands of the west coast of Scotland, creating quiet, restrained and beautifully crafted spaces." +
                        "Theirs is an architecture based on the rigorous study of site, context, and landscape, inspired by a specific location, working in harmony with the surrounding" +
                        "environment and landscape.\n\n" +

                        "The Tour\n\n" +

                        "Accessed via a four-mile single track, the tranquil hamlet of Skinidin is nestled on the western shore of Loch Dunvegan. A linear village, it comprises a" +
                        "scattered collection of small crofts, houses and agricultural buildings and has mesmerising landscape views from any position.\n" +

                        "Sitting modestly in its setting, the house is set back from the road by a short track leading to a generous parking area. The minimal material palette and " +
                        "barn-like profile of the house nod to the raw and straightforward West Highland building tradition. Aluminium-clad timber windows punctuate the larch-clad façades," +
                        " while a dark grey roof is counterpointed by a shiny stainless steel flue and several roof lights. An exacting approach to the key principles of light, space and" +
                        "  direct visual contextuality has been adopted." +

                        "A secluded glazed doorway provides the primary entrance into a lobby, with ample space for hanging coats and storing boots. Beyond the sociable open-plan kitchen," +
                        " living and dining room unfolds. Attuned to easy living, this expansive room has an exceptional quality of ever-changing light. Swathes of floor-to-ceiling glazing" +
                        "  and aptly positioned windows frame breathtaking views of the sloping topography towards the loch shores, heather-clad moorland and distant mountains." +

                        "The seating area is centred around a warming wood-burning stove set in a large recessed chimney breast, with space for log storage. " +
                        "On each side of the fireplace are cosy nooks, where picture windows frame the backdrop. The open-plan nature of the room also means it is large enough" +
                        "for entertaining on a small or large scale." +

                        "In warmer months, sliding glass doors open the entire dining area onto the timber deck, which wraps around the southern and easterly façades of the house." +
                        " This is the perfect spot for a morning coffee or barbeque lunch. The kitchen, with a generous provision of cabinetry, is simply detailed and thoughtfully considered," +
                        "  creating clever aesthetic cohesion in the spaces. A handy utility room is also positioned at ground-floor level, leading directly to a wet room. There are" +
                        "   plenty of cupboards throughout the plan for everyday paraphernalia." +

                        "A central oak staircase leads to the serene upper level. Here lie two large double bedrooms, both naturally quiet and peaceful retreats." +
                        "A family bathroom sits centrally. Like the rest of the house, these rooms have plenty of storage cleverly built into the eaves and have far-reaching compelling views." +

                        "Outdoor Space" +

                        "The house sits on a slightly elevated level, with gently inclined grassy slopes falling towards the quiet approach road. Sitting lightly in its plot of just" +
                        "over half an acre, it is visually anchored into its surrounding landscape. Sea eagles and red-and-black-throated divers fly overhead, and sheep grazing the" +
                        "heathery banks are frequent visitors. The adjacent shores, where afternoons can be spent walking or foraging, offer invigorating wild swimming and paddle" +
                        "boarding year-round. The house has a handy integral external store, a useful place for fishing rods and wet suits." +

                        "At night, the sky is ablaze with stars, and, on occasion, the compellingly beautiful aurora borealis, the Milky Way, and noctilucent clouds make" +
                        "spectacular appearances in winter months." +

                        "The Area" +

                        "Skinidin is a small settlement located four miles west of Dunvegan, a small town offering a good provision of daily amenities and a petrol station." +
                        "Glendale village is also nearby, with a shop and post office. The main town Portree is 26 miles east, on Skye." +

                        "The island is an inspiring wilderness surrounded by stunning landscapes and an extraordinary place for wildlife watching." +
                        "Otters, seals, whales, dolphins and red deer, amongst others, roam wild on and around the island. There is excellent scope for mountain" +
                        "walking and hiking on the Kintail hills, Cuillin Range and The Trotternish Ridge beckon directly from the house’s front door." +
                        "The Cuillin Range has 12 Munros – peaks above 3,000 ft (914m) – for the more experienced climbers. Neist Point Lighthouse is an excellent spot" +
                        " for its beautiful coastal scenery and to observe whales, dolphins and even the occasional basking sharks. On warmer days, Coral Beach provides" +
                        "  a lovely backdrop for a picnic." +

                        "In recent years, Skye has built a reputation as a real foodie destination." +
                        "A particularly notable restaurant is at Three Chimneys, less than a mile from the house and once voted in the top 50 restaurants worldwide." +
                        " Stein is home to other beautiful eateries. The Loch Bay restaurant is Michelin-starred, and The Stein Inn is the oldest inn on the island," +
                        "  dating back to the 18th century. There is also the popular restaurant Edinbane Lodge," +
                        "  located in a 16th-century hunting lodge and many other cafes for delicious lunches and dinners." +

                        "Skye is connected to the mainland by a free road bridge. There is a bus service from Portree to Glasgow and Inverness. Otherwise," +
                        "it is approximately a three-hour drive to Inverness, with flights to London Luton and Gatwick in around an hour. " +
                        "There are also regular and sleeper trains from Inverness to London. Fort William is a gateway to the islands and sits about 68 miles southeast." +
                        "Ferries from the island also go to Mallaig on the mainland and the nearby islands of Harris and Lewis." +
